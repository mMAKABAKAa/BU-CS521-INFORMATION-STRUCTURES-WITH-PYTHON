The Pomodoro Technique is a popular time management method that involves working in focused 25-minute stretches, 
followed by 5-minute breaks. After four pomodoros, take a longer break of 20 minutes. This method is effective in enhancing productivity and concentration. 

With remote work becoming more prevalent, it's easy to get distracted during breaks, When I work at home, I canâ€™t help playing cellphone at the breaks, which defeats the purpose of taking a break. 

To address this issue, I developed a Pomodoro-Workout Clock that incorporates full body stretches and exercises to help you relax and re-energize during breaks. Of course, if you prefer to rest, you can simply choose to lie down.
